# OwniX DURA Staking & Mining AutoReward Project

## Overview

The **OwniX DURA Staking & Mining AutoReward** project integrates **Proof of Data Usage** (DURA) for mining rewards, where users are rewarded based on their real-world data usage. The system also includes a **dynamic mining rate**, **auto-reward system**, and **batch mining** to minimize transaction costs.

## Features

- **Proof of Data Usage (DURA)**: Users are rewarded based on their data usage, with rewards calculated dynamically using a **SHA-256 hashing mechanism**.
- **Dynamic Mining Rate**: Reward decreases after every 1 billion tokens mined, similar to Bitcoinâ€™s halving.
- **Auto-Reward System**: Rewards are automatically distributed to user wallets when they mine tokens, no manual claims needed.
- **Cooldown Mechanism**: 30 seconds cooldown period between each mining transaction to avoid spam.
- **Batch Mining**: Multiple proofs can be submitted in a single transaction to optimize gas fees.
- **Proof Verification**: The `cell_hash()` function ensures integrity and tamper-proof proof of data usage.
- **Anti-Spam Mechanism**: Cooldown and proof verification mechanisms to prevent spam mining activities.
- **Owner Reserved Tokens**: 20% of the total supply is reserved for the owner for project growth, marketing, and listings.

## Tokenomics

### **Total Supply**: 8,000,000,000 OWNIX Tokens

- **Mining Supply**: 80% (6,400,000,000 OWNIX)
- **Owner Reserved**: 20% (1,600,000,000 OWNIX)

### **Mining Rewards**:
- **Dynamic Mining Rate**: Mining rewards decrease every 1 billion tokens mined.
- **Auto-Reward**: Rewards are sent directly to users without needing manual interaction.
- **Staking**: Users must lock tokens for 90 days to 1 year to participate in mining.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Project foundation and smart contract deployment.
- **Phase 2**: Token launch, mining starts, and staking.
- **Phase 3**: Expansion and ecosystem adoption.
- **Phase 4**: Ecosystem growth and governance implementation.

## How to Participate

1. **Mining**: Users can submit their data usage and mine tokens using the **Proof of Data Usage** mechanism. Tokens are mined based on data usage, and rewards are distributed immediately.
2. **Staking**: Users must lock their OWNIX tokens for a minimum of 90 days to participate in mining rewards.

## Smart Contract Address

The smart contract is deployed on the **TON Blockchain**. You can interact with it directly from your wallet for mining and reward distribution.
